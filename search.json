    "text": "Assessment\nThe goal of these labs is to introduce you to, and build up your proficiency with, R and RStudio. You’ll be using these throughout the course, both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the lectures and also to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. To straighten out which is which:\nThe R language is the standard statistical tool used by most statisticians at universities. One reason data scientists and statisticians like to use R is that all known statistical techniques are available in R. Whenever someone develops a new statistical technique, one of the first things they do is produce an R package so that the technique becomes available in R. The reason they do this for R rather than for one of the commercial alternatives is that R is open source and freely available to all, and of course that the previous methods on which the new method builds are already available in R.\nFeeling comfortable using R is not only important for this module and any further statistics modules you may take at the Department of Mathematics of the University of York, it can also be an important factor for your future career (see the article “R skills attract the highest salaries”. Even though R is specially designed for statistics, it is consistently in the list of the top ten most important programming languages compiled by the IEEE spectrum magazine.\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer.\nThe Intro lab does not count for credit, but you should attempt this in the first week of the semester to make sure that:",

    "text": "The data: Dr. Arbuthnot’s baptism records\nIn this introduction we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nThe first step is to open RStudio.\nOnce you’ve opened RStudio, you should see a window similar to that depicted below.\nA good way to work through these labs is is to have this file open on one half of your screen and RStudio on the other half. On a PC you can usually move a window to the left or right half of the screen by holding down the Windows key and pressing the left or right arrow key.\nThe panel in the upper right of the RStudio window contains your Environment as well as a History of the commands that you’ve previously entered. The lower right panel has several tabs, including Plots where any plots that you generate will show up.\nThe panel on the left is where the action happens. It’s called the Console. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have text at the top of the console giving lots of information that you can mostly ignore, including the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the prompt. As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.\nTo get you started, enter the following command at the R prompt (i.e. right after &gt; on the console). You can either type it in manually or copy and paste it from this document.\nThis command instructs R to access the OpenIntro website and fetch some data: the Arbuthnot baptism counts for boys and girls. You should see that the environment area in the upper right hand corner of the RStudio window now lists a data set called arbuthnot that has 82 observations on 3 variables.\nAs you interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the by-product of a computation or some analysis you have performed.\nNote that because it is accessing data on the web, the above command will work in a computer lab, in the library, or at home; just as long as you have access to the internet.\nThe Arbuthnot data set was compiled by Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18th century physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in London for every year from 1629 to 1710. We can take a look at the data by typing its name into the console and hitting Enter.\narbuthnot\nWhat you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptised that year, respectively. Use the scroll bar on the right side of the console window to examine the complete data set.\nMoving back to the console, if we only want to see the first few lines of the data set, we can type\nhead(arbuthnot)\n#&gt;   year boys girls\n#&gt; 1 1629 5218  4683\n#&gt; 2 1630 4858  4457\n#&gt; 3 1631 4422  4102\n#&gt; 4 1632 4994  4590\n#&gt; 5 1633 5158  4839\n#&gt; 6 1634 5035  4820\nSometimes, as in this example, I’ll show you the output of the commands when I run them on my computer, so that you can compare with what you get when you run the commands yourself: any line starting with #&gt; corresponds to code output.\nNote that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot’s data. R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored Arbuthnot’s data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a data frame.\nYou can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing:\ndim(arbuthnot)\n#&gt; [1] 82  3\nThis indicates that there are 82 rows and 3 columns (we’ll get to what the [1] means in a bit), just as it says next to the object in your Environment tab. You can see the names of these columns (or variables) by typing:\nnames(arbuthnot) \n#&gt; [1] \"year\"  \"boys\"  \"girls\"\nYou should see that the data frame contains the columns year, boys, and girls. By this point, you might have noticed that many of the commands in R look a lot like functions; that is, invoking R commands means supplying a function with some number of arguments. The dim() and names() commands, for example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame.",

    "section": "Some exploration",
    "text": "Some exploration\nLet’s start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like\n\narbuthnot$boys\n\nThis command will only show the number of boys baptised each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nWhat command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptised each year? Try it!Now answer quiz question 1.\n\n\nNotice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of the display. These data are no longer structured in a table with other variables, so they are displayed one right after another.\nObjects that print out in this way are called vectors; they represent a set of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example, 5218 follows [1], indicating that 5218 is the first entry in the vector. And if [43] starts a line, then that would mean the first number on that line would represent the 43rd entry in the vector.\nR has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptised per year with the command\n\nplot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = arbuthnot$girls) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, R creates a scatterplot with each (x,y) pair indicated by an open circle. The plot itself should appear under the Plots tab of the lower right panel of RStudio.\nNotice that the command above again looks like a function, this time with two arguments separated by a comma. The first argument in the plot function specifies the variable for the x-axis and the second for the y-axis. If we wanted to connect the data points with lines, we could add a third argument, the letter l for line.\n\nplot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = arbuthnot$girls, type = \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might wonder how you are supposed to know that it was possible to add that third argument. Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively: you’ve already seen that clicking on any of the underlined commands in this page takes you to the relevant entry in the documentation. Another way to read what a function does, and learn the arguments that are available to you, is to just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you’re interested in. Try the following.\n\n?plot\n\nCan you figure out how to produce a plot that shows both the points and the lines connecting them?\nNotice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nIs there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptised over the years?Answer quiz question 2.\nCan you also guess, just by looking at the graph, when the English civil war started?\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in mathematical expressions like\n\n5218 + 4683\n\nto see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys and girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.\n\narbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls\n\nWhat you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we aren’t looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum we’re after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right.\nWe can now make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command\n\nplot(arbuthnot$year, arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls, type = \"l\")\n\nThis time, note that we left out the names of the first two arguments. We can do this because the help file shows that the default for plot is for the first argument to be the x-variable and the second argument to be the y-variable.\nNext we calculate the proportion of the baptised children that are boys. We can do this for the year 1629 with the command\n\n5218 / (5218 + 4683)\n\nbut this may also be computed for all years simultaneously:\n\narbuthnot$boys / (arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls)\n\nNote that with R, as with your calculator, you need to be conscious of the order of operations. Here, we want to divide the number of boys by the total number of newborns, so we have to use parentheses. Without them, R will first do the division, then the addition, giving you something that is not a proportion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nNow, make a plot of the proportion of boys over time. The command for making the plot will be similar to the plot command you used earlier, just with a different expression for the y argument.Now answer quiz question 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you use the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through your previous commands, your so-called command history. You can also access it by clicking on the History tab in the upper right panel. This will save you a lot of typing in the future.\n\n\nIn addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, &gt;, less than, &lt;, and equality, == (note that it has to be a double equal sign, not a single equal sign). For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each year with the expression\n\narbuthnot$boys &gt; arbuthnot$girls\n\nThis command returns 82 values of either TRUE if that year had more boys than girls, or FALSE if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This output shows a different kind of data than we have considered so far. In the arbuthnot data frame our values are numerical (the year, the number of boys and girls). Here, we’ve asked R to create logical data, data where the values are either TRUE or FALSE. In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and compute with many of them.\nYou can count the number of entries for which the condition is TRUE by just summing the entries in the vector\n\nsum(arbuthnot$boys &gt; arbuthnot$girls)\n\nThe reason this works is that R automatically converts TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0 when asked to do a numerical calculation with these values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nAbove you have seen how to calculate the proportion of newborns that are boys. You have also learned how to count the number of entries in the data that satisfy a particular condition.Now combine those two to answer quiz question 4.",
